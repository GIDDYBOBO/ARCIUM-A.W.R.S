# ARCIUM Anonymous Wallet Reputation System (A.W.R.S)

## Overview
A multi-chain privacy-preserving wallet reputation system supporting Ethereum and Solana with anonymous leaderboards and cross-chain trustworthiness scores. Users can prove their reputation without revealing their wallet addresses using ZK proofs and privacy-preserving computation through ARCIUM.

## Project Architecture

### Database Schema
Created comprehensive database schema with the following tables:
- **users**: Store wallet addresses, chains, and pseudonymous IDs
- **reputation_scores**: Track overall and category-specific reputation scores
- **leaderboard**: Anonymous rankings without revealing wallet addresses
- **minted_nfts**: NFTs earned through reputation achievements
- **activities**: Track on-chain activities affecting reputation
- **zk_proofs**: Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving verification

### Backend Structure
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **API**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Storage**: Interface-based storage layer with database implementation
- **Routes**: RESTful API endpoints for all entities

### Key Features
- Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Solana)
- Anonymous leaderboards using pseudonymous IDs
- ZK proof generation and verification
- NFT minting for reputation achievements
- Activity tracking for reputation calculation
- Privacy-preserving reputation scores

## Database Tables Created

### Core Tables:
1. **users** - Wallet management with pseudonymous identities
2. **reputation_scores** - Comprehensive scoring system
3. **leaderboard** - Anonymous rankings
4. **minted_nfts** - Achievement NFTs
5. **activities** - On-chain activity tracking
6. **zk_proofs** - Privacy verification

### Reputation Categories:
- Overall score
- DAO participation score
- DeFi activity score
- NFT trading score
- Bridge usage score
- Voting participation score
- Scam avoidance score

## API Endpoints Created

- `POST /api/users` - Create new user

### Reputation System
- `GET /api/reputation/:walletAddress` - Get reputation score
- `POST /api/reputation` - Create reputation score
- `PUT /api/reputation/:userId` - Update reputation score

### Leaderboard
- `GET /api/leaderboard` - Get anonymous leaderboard
- `GET /api/leaderboard/position/:pseudonymousId` - Get user position
- `POST /api/leaderboard/update` - Update leaderboard rankings

### NFT Management
- `GET /api/nfts/:walletAddress` - Get minted NFTs
- `POST /api/nfts` - Record new NFT mint
- `GET /api/nfts/token/:tokenId/:contractAddress` - Get specific NFT

### Activity Tracking
- `GET /api/activities/:walletAddress` - Get user activities
- `POST /api/activities` - Record new activity
- `GET /api/activities/:userId/type/:activityType` - Get activities by type

### ZK Proofs
- `GET /api/zkproofs/:walletAddress` - Get user ZK proofs
- `POST /api/zkproofs` - Create ZK proof
- `GET /api/zkproofs/verify/:proofHash` - Verify ZK proof
